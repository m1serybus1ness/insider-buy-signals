# Insider Buy Signals

A marketplace where you can buy and sell crypto trading signals.

## How it works

Sellers create listings with trading signals and set a price in ETH. Buyers browse available signals and purchase the ones they want. All signals are encrypted before being stored on the blockchain.

After purchasing a signal, buyers can rate sellers to help others make better decisions.

## Getting started

1. Connect your wallet (works on Sepolia testnet)
2. Browse signals in the "signals$" section
3. Create your own listing in "sell signal$"
4. Check seller ratings in "sellers$"
5. Learn more in "about$"

That's it. Simple and straightforward.
